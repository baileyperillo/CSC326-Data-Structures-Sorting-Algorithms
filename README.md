Feedback: number of steps were wrong on some algorithms, therefore graphs are wrong. Some of the time complexities might are wrong.

This project was to code different algorithms as shown in class and to evaluate and compare their time complexities by running all algorithms with different 
sets of numbers at the same time and recording their time to finish and number of steps it took to complete the task. 

This group was able to learn more about Big O notation.
